# Research: Model Selection and Evaluation

This folder contains exploratory notebooks and utilities used to:

- Prepare and clean coordinate data
- Engineer features and define zones
- Train and compare multiple regression models
- Analyze prediction accuracy and polygon geometry
- Visualize results on interactive maps

## Notebooks

- `01_data_preparation.ipynb`: Data loading, coordinate parsing, and preprocessing
- `02_model_training.ipynb`: Model training and performance comparison
- `03_results_analysis.ipynb`: Evaluation of geometric accuracy and visualization

## Notes

- All sensitive identifiers (e.g. parcel numbers) were replaced with anonymized codes like `sample_001_023`
- Coordinates are preserved to allow reproducibility of model behavior and evaluation
